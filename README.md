## 🤔 About

Whisper is a web application offering a secure and private space for users to anonymously share their deepest thoughts, personal stories, and profound secrets. Its primary goal is to empower individuals to freely express themselves without concern of judgment or exposure while finding comfort in the shared experiences of others. Additionally, whisper serves as a platform where users can also enjoy lighthearted or humorous content, relishing in funny yet potentially embarrassing stories posted by individuals. 

If you're interested in learning about our development and design process, you can go to my dev log and search for articles with the 'whisper' tag (once I'm done writing them lol).

## 🎈 Usage

Whisper offers two primary functionalities: writing and reading secrets anonymously. To access the secrets shared by others, users must first contribute their own secret. Once a secret is submitted, it gets securely stored in the database. Upon submission, an engaging animation precedes the display of a secret authored by another user. This cycle continues, allowing users to read a new secret for every one they contribute. Importantly, whisper maintains a strict privacy policy—only the secrets themselves are stored, ensuring the confidentiality of user information and preserving anonymity.
